    "Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification. Gaussian Naive Bayes is an extension of the Naive Bayes algorithm that assumes the features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. It is particularly suitable for continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of multi-class classification, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be adapted to handle multiple classes. The idea is to extend the algorithm to estimate the parameters (mean and variance) for each class separately. The decision rule is then applied to determine the most probable class for a given input based on the Gaussian probability distribution.\n",

    "While Gaussian Naive Bayes is commonly used for continuous data, it's important to note that if the features are not well-modeled by a Gaussian distribution, other variants of Naive Bayes (such as Multinomial or Bernoulli Naive Bayes) might be more appropriate for certain types of data, especially in text classification or discrete feature scenarios."
